## About
  An app built with React Native where you can play the game Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer, over and over and over again ðŸŽ‰. When deciding how to build the game I did a bit of research how others have approached the problem by downloading 3 apps from the App Store. Overall, I found those apps too complicated, in one of them I didn't even figure out how to play the game. Rock, paper, scissors is a game everyone knows, no need to complicate things :). Therefore, I decided to keep it as simple as possible. The app is a single screen application where pressing the rock/paper/scissors buttons triggers a game to be played.

## Improvements I'd like to do
- [ ] Show a countdown once you have pressed rock/paper/scissors button
- [ ] Show visually what the computer chose
- [ ] Allow player to enter his/her name
- [ ] Animate the rock/paper/scissors button you chose, e.g. make it bigger, while the countdown is going on

## Prerequisites for running the app
  1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  3. (Optional) [Expo app](https://expo.io) to view the app on your phone
  4. (Optional) [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12#) for running the app on an iOS simulator on a Mac

## Running the app
  1. Clone the project to your computer
  2. Open Terminal/Command prompt
  3. Navigate to the project directory
  4. Run `$ npm install`
  5. You now have two options of viewing/running the app:
